		<h3>Instructions</h3>
		<p>Pig is a simple game to learn but a difficult game to master. In fact, mathematicians use this game to teach probability in higher-level math classes.</p>
		<p>This game can be played with as few as 2 players, and there is no limit to how many players. Although if you have 30 friends, this might not be the best use of your time.</p>

		<h4>Materials</h4>
		<ul class="pigs">
			<li>A die (a variant can be played with 2 dice)</li>
			<li>A paper to keep score</li>
			<li>A writing utensil</li>
		</ul>
		<hr>

		<h4>Objective</h4>
		<p>To be the first player to score 100 or more points.</p>
		<hr>

		<h4>How to Play</h4>
		<ol class="numberedPigs">
			<li>The player rolls the die.</li>
			<li>If the die shows a 1, all the points for that turn are lost and the die passes to the next player.</li>
			<li>If a die shows any other number, the value is added to the current turn total.</li>
			<li>After each roll, the player may choose to roll again or hold their points and pass the die.</li>
			<li>Once the die is passed, the player adds their turn sum to their total points.</li>
		</ol>
		<hr>

		<h3>Variants</h3>
		<h4>Pigs (Two Dice Variant)</h4>
		<p>This variant of Pig (let's call it Pigs) uses 2 dice. The game plays the same as above with the following addendums.</p>
		<ul class="pigs">
			<li>If either dice shows a 1, all the points for that turn are lost and the dice pass to the next player.</li>
			<li>If both dice show a 1, the players score returns to 0 and the dice pass to the next player. PIG OUT!</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Big Pig</h4>
		<p>This quicker variant uses 2 dice and plays the same as Pigs (above). This variant has 2 changes.</p>
		<ul class="pigs">
			<li>If both dice show a 1, the player gets 25 points and can continue rolling.</li>
			<li>If any other doubles are rolled, the player adds twice the sum of the dice. For example, rolling two 5s gives 20 points.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Swine Herd</h4>
		<p>This variant is meant for a large group to play Pig quickly together.</p>
		<ol class="numberedPigs">
			<li>All players stand up and take turns at the same time.</li>
			<li>One player (the "swineherd") rolls a die for everyone.</li>
			<li>After each roll, the swineherd declares the current running total and players are allowed to sit down to hold the current sum.</li>
			<li>Sitting players call out their new scores.</li>
			<li>The turn continues until all players are sitting down or a 1 is rolled. Those standing when a 1 is rolled lose the points for that turn.</li>
			<li>If two or more players score 100 or over in the same roll, they share the win and end the game in a tie.</li>
		</ol>
