Welcome to the Pig Game - Week 1

Problems encountered:
ComputerPlayer takeTurn() - Without code to check isMyTurn, the Take Turn button wouldn't end turn at the end of the maximumRolls.

ComputerPane handle(ActionEvent arg0) - Without code to resetTurnTotal(), the previous turnTotal remained and rolling 1 resulted in a reduced total score.
