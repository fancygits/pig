CS6910 Pig Game - James Luke Johnson

New Features:

~~~ Start New Game ~~~				4 Points
The user can start a new game at any time. By clicking New in the File menu (or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + N), 
the scores are reset to 0 and the previously chosen first player will begin the game again.

To implement this feature, I first created a method in Player to resetGame. Since it works the same for both computer
and human players, I programmed it in AbstractPlayer. It simply resets the turnTotal and total to 0. Once tested, I 
ran those methods in the startNewGame method of Game. Next, I added a "New" menu option in my MenuPane with a keyboard
shortcut. To keep track of which player originally went first, I added an instance variable and getter method to Game. It
made sense to add it to Game since the various Pane classes all communicated with the Game model. Furthermore, the data 
should be kept separate from the view, if possible.
During testing, I encountered problems where both player panes were disabled and the MenuPane had no way to setDisable(false)
so I moved the entire MenuPane class inside PigPane, similar to NewGamePane. This fixed the issues since I could now directly
change properties of the panes.


~~~ Auto Turn-Taking Computer ~~~	4 Points
The computer will no longer require the Take Turn button to roll. By selecting the new Options Menu, and checking Auto-Roll
option, the computer will take its turn without any user input.

To implement this feature, I first added an instance variable to ComputerPlayer called autoRoll, along with a getter and
setter. I chose to use ComputerPlayer since it's shared data and belongs in the model. Then, I created a new Options menu 
with a CheckMenuItem for Auto-Roll. I added a check in ComputerPane to change the button text if Auto-Roll isSelected.
To notify the the user that the computer was taking turns, I added a Timeline feature with the button text changing for 
one second. I had issues with the timeline continuing to take turns during the HumanPlayer's turn, so I added an additional
check if the currentPlayer == computerPlayer. This was a lot of trial and error and researching solutions, but it seems 
to work nicely now.
One bug, the ComputerPane autoRolls twice. The button doesn't change to Waiting until 1 second AFTER the turn is already
finished. It doesn't seem to affect game play (the ComputerPlayer doesn't take two turns), but it annoys me.
